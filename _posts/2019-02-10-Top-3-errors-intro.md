_Reading time: 3 minutes_ - We discuss the three main errors that students make in the Introduction Section of a Lab Report, and how to successfully avoid making those errors.

 
## **Error 1/3**
### *The Error:* No Rationale
 
The main point of the Introduction section is to cover the literature, talk about a gap in the literature and show that your study fills that gap. This is all about building a rationale for your study. As in: “What’s the point of it? Why do it?”
 
Very often in an Introduction section, students will cover the literature, cover the literature some more, and then BAM, it’s the Methods section. This misses the point.
 
The introduction is a very good place to demonstrate that you know all the literature, that you’ve done further reading, that you really know what you’re talking about. But that’s not all – you must build a rationale.
 
### *The Solution:* Explicitly State the Rationale
 
The golden solution is to have a paragraph that starts: “The rationale for this study is…”
 
This makes it pretty hard to argue that you don’t have a rationale. It’s right there at the start of a paragraph, where the important sentences go.
 
You’ll also need to actually identify a gap in the literature. So, have your amazing coverage of the literature but build that narrative around the gap.
 
Ideas for rationales:  

* The study has not been done with this particular sample  
* The methods available are more accurate, so we have a better way to test the theory  
* The findings are out of date and need replicating
 
## **Error 2/3**
### *The Error:* No Definitions
 
In your Lab Report you’re going to talk about some pretty fancy and technical stuff. You’re a genius, you know the literature (or at least you want to make it seem that way), and you’re going to get into the nitty gritty.
 
You need to bear in mind though that people don’t know the literature as well as you do. And even if they did, and were world experts, they might not see the topic from the same perspective as you.
 
You might be thinking of one thing when you say “happiness”, but your reader may have something entirely different in mind.
 
I like to say that you’re 'playing tennis on two different courts'.
 
At best, you’ve simply forgotten to have some definitions and you’ll lose marks for that only. At worst, your reader will have no idea what you’re talking about and the Lab Report will make no sense to them. Let’s not risk it – there’s an easy solution.
 
### *The Solution:* Define Terms Early
 
You’ve seen definitions before, but as a reminder they go something like this:
 
> "Happiness is defined as the positive emotion felt when someone smiles at you (Ashcroft, 2019)."
 
The above is a paraphrase of a fictional article by me. You could also have a direct quote:
 
> "Happiness is defined as “… that emotion that you feel when someone, such as a family member or friend, smiles at you” (Ashcroft, 2019, p.19)."
 
Both are completely fine. Avoid having too many direct quotes. Remember those page numbers. 
 
Direct quotes are super useful if you just want to use authority to tell your reader: “this is what I’m talking about now, so just take my word for it”.
 
Paraphrases are nice to use when the definition in question is more commonly agreed upon. 
 
This should happen pretty early on in a Lab Report. You should define the main terms in your Lab Report in the first paragraph or so.
 
For other definitions of secondary importance, define the term the first time the term is used. For example:
 
> "People really like chocolate (a popular sweet item of confectionary usually made from milk and cocoa, among other ingredients; Ashcroft, 2019)."
 
Don’t play tennis on two different courts. Bring the reader onto your court.
 
## **Error 3/3**
### *The Error:* Incorrectly Discussing the Literature
 
I admit that this error sounds a bit broad, and it is. There’s so many ways to discuss the literature incorrectly in the Introduction section of a Lab Report.
 
Here’s some examples:
 
> "There are loads of studies about dinosaurs and chocolate in the literature. Dinosaurs are defined as…"
 
Why this is incorrect: 
 
Firstly, they have mentioned studies and have not cited any of them. Bad practice. Secondly, they have set themselves up for a really hard time. The reader will now be expecting dozens and dozens of citations. It’s an uphill battle now.
 
Instead:
 
> "The present report assesses whether or not dinosaurs like chocolate, as has been suggested previously (Ashcroft, 2010). Dinosaurs are defined as…"
 
Another example of incorrectly discussing the literature:
 
> "Brians and McDonald (2016) studied dinosaurs and chocolate. McGyver and Frankenstein (1985) also studied dinosaurs and chocolate. Another study about dinosaurs and chocolate is by…"
 
Why this is incorrect:
 
The writer of this text isn’t actually adding any information into the Lab Report with these sentences. They need to say what those researchers did, and what they found.
 
At the very minimum you need to say what researchers had as the conclusion of their study.
 
Instead:
 
> "Brians and McDonald (2016) discovered that dinosaurs are drawn to the scent of cocoa, but their study did not involve actual consumption. McGyver and Frankenstein (1985) used a longitudinal design where dinosaurs were…"
 
There are so many more examples of how people discuss the literature incorrectly. Here’s the take home message about how to avoid these errors.
 
The Solution: Be Selective, Be Detailed
 
There are two key aspects to discussing the literature correctly in a Lab Report Introduction section.
 
Firstly, be selective. 
 
There are so many studies about dinosaurs, and there so many studies about preference for chocolate, and most of these are utterly irrelevant.
 
For the most part, you want to be discussing research about dinosaurs and chocolate. You might have one study that defines dinosaurs, another that defines chocolate, and that’s about it for the separate topics. All the rest should really be about dinosaurs and chocolate, because that’s the central narrative of your Lab Report.
 
Any citations about sheep and their preference for bananas will not be useful. You might be citing the best information ever about sheep and bananas, but this has nothing to do with your narrative.
 
Be selective.
 
Secondly, be detailed.
 
Say what the researchers did. Say what the researchers found. This could be summarised in just a few words if needed. It needn’t be a paragraph. At the very least, state the conclusion that the researchers came to.
