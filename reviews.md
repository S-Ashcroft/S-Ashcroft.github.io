everything you need to know. Highly recommended."***

>***"This excellent book elicited reactions in me that I didn't think possible from a book on how to write scientific and scholarly psychology laboratory reports insofar as I smiled, and smiled again, and then smiled some more. It is smart, irreverent, snappy, yet thoroughly engaging, nuanced, current, practical, and choc-full of dollops of experience and wisdom. I like the fact that the authors are not afraid to acknowledge and indeed promote the utility of modern online realities such as google scholar and wikipedia as more traditional academic texts on writing lab reports do not typically capture this or indeed tend to unnecessarily steer students away from such resources. Includes excellent step-by-step suggestions on how to develop a research database and how to really showcase some critical and analytical flair in discussion sections to gain those higher marks. It is a timely book that meets the needs of of the modern psychology student and it will be core reading for my experimental psychology modules."***

>***"The authors of this extremely useful guide have done an excellent job of making a potentially dry and technical subject very accessible. In a friendly and entertaining style, this book guides the reader through every step of the preparation of a lab report, providing very helpful and pragmatic advice throughout. Whilst I found myself wishing I had had access to something like this back when I was an undergraduate, I can also see myself picking it up the next time I write a paper for publication in a journal."***
