>***"Short. Comprehensive. Easy to understand. What's not to like? If you need to know how to do a lab report
you don't want to waste time wandering in a wilderness of vague platitudes. This little book will tell you
everything you need to know. Highly recommended.***"

**Steven C. Hayes, Nevada Foundation Professor, Behavior Analysis, Department of Psychology at the University of Nevada**
