you don't want to waste time wandering in a wilderness of vague platitudes. This little book will tell you
everything you need to know. Highly recommended."

>"This excellent book elicited reactions in me that I didn't think possible from a book on how to write scientific and scholarly psychology laboratory reports insofar as I smiled, and smiled again, and then smiled some more. It is smart, irreverent, snappy, yet thoroughly engaging, nuanced, current, practical, and choc-full of dollops of experience and wisdom.  
>I like the fact that the authors are not afraid to acknowledge and indeed promote the utility of modern online realities such as Google Scholar and Wikipedia as more traditional academic texts on writing lab reports do not typically capture this or indeed tend to unnecessarily steer students away from such resources. Includes excellent step-by-step suggestions on how to develop a research database and how to really showcase some critical and analytical flair in discussion sections to gain those higher marks.  
>It is a timely book that meets the needs of the modern psychology student and it will be core reading for my experimental psychology modules."

>"The authors of this extremely useful guide have done an excellent job of making a potentially dry and technical subject very accessible. In a friendly and entertaining style, this book guides the reader through every step of the preparation of a lab report, providing very helpful and pragmatic advice throughout. Whilst I found myself wishing I had had access to something like this back when I was an undergraduate, I can also see myself picking it up the next time I write a paper for publication in a journal."

>"'How to write a lab report’ by Ashcroft and Kennedy, provides a checklist of tips and strategies on..you’ve guessed it..how to write a lab report.  
>I was pleasantly surprised with how easy the book was to read and navigate, (something that is not common in the sector). It is perfect for a student to quickly check what a good lab report should consist of without trudging through reams of unnecessary and confusing information. The E-book feature is also really handy for students to keep on their devices.  
>This book would be very useful for social science students who write up lab reports. I hope the authors consider expanding to other types of assessments and disciplines in the future!"
