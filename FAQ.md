# What goes in the Materials/apparatus/procedure section? {#materials} 
The things you used

# What is marker looking for? {#marker} 
Follow the marking criteria and you'll know!

# What are the main ways students lose grades? {#losegrades} 
Submit late, don't submit at all, spelling mistakes, not following the brief

# What in lab reports always makes you laugh? {#laugh} 
For some reason, many students spell my name (Sam Ashcroft) incorrectly. I’ve seen everything – Ashworth, Ashbrost, Ashbrook… I have a little file that I add these misspellings to.  

# What small things in lab reports can annoy a marker? {#annoy} 
Your marker should always be objective. But still, markers are human and some things can be annoying. Putting your name on work that should be anonymous is quite annoying, because it means it is a bit harder to objectively mark your work. And I suppose, messing up something that we have been directly teaching you for weeks can be a bit annoying. It’s absolutely fine to get something challenging a bit wrong. That’s super fine, and we’re super chilled about it. But if we’ve told you for the last three weeks which hypotheses to put in your work, and you’ve written something completely different, that’s annoying. It’s not because we expect you to please us with your exceptional work. It’s actually because we want you to do well, and we want to know that our teaching is making a difference.

# Have you always been good at lab reports? {#goodlabreports} 
No, we have had to learn. That’s why we wrote this book

# Do people really get good grades? {#goodgrades} 
Yes! 98, 96  

# How can you deal with the stress of university? {#stress} 
You can't
