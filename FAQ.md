# What is this website about? {#websiteabout} 
This is the supplementary website to the eBook "How to Write a Lab Report" which will be launching on Amazon on the 14th April 2019.

We want to give you all the information you need about Lab Reports, so that you can become a Lab Report expert.

On this website you will find our frequently updated blog, where we offer useful tips and tricks on writing Lab Reports. We have loads of blog posts in the pipeline, so sign up to receive updates [here](https://labreport.org/blog-subscribe/)

We also post useful information about Lab Report writing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LabReport) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/LabReport.Org)

# Who wrote the book, runs the website, and posts on social media? {#whoweare} 
You can find out all this information on the page [About Us](https://labreport.org/aboutus/)

To summarise, we are both teaching staff at University, and we largely teach students how to do good research and write up Lab Reports. We are also completing our PhDs.

Together we have extensive experience in how to write Lab Reports, and we want to share all that experience with you.

# When is the book available? {#launchdate}
The book will be available on Amazon from the 14th April 2019.

We have decided to publish on Amazon because this keeps costs low for you (avoiding publisher fees which would drive the price up), and also because it is a reputable marketing service. This means that you can trust the reviews and trust the seller.

# What content does the book contain? {#bookcontent}
We have written a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to writing Lab Reports.

The book contains not only in-depth guides on how to write each section, but also has considerable content on how to improve your writing style, has a checklist to use to make sure you haven't missed anything, has a detailed walkthrough on how to find resources and organise your reading, has time-saving tips and tricks for each stage of the process, and more.

If you want to know how to write a Lab Report, this is for you.

# Who is this book for? {#bookfor}
This book is for _anyone_ that is interested in writing Lab Reports. 

There will be useful information for you that will help take your Lab Reports to the next level.

The book was initially written with degree-level / college-level students in mind, but given its depth it will be useful for people just starting out with Lab Reports, and those people that have been writing Lab Reports for years. There's always something extra to learn.

# What's so hard about writing Lab Reports? {#hardreports}
There are hundreds of rules to know when writing Lab Reports, and it takes a long, long time to find out these rules, understand them, and put them into practice successfully. Most resources available only give you the absolute basics, without explaining the tips and tricks to take your writing from beginner to expert, or they only focus on one particular thing, meaning you have to search around for other information. It is a massive, time-consuming process that can be quite frustrating. We know. We've been there and got the t-shirt.

That's where we come in. We've been there! We've done degrees, Masters, we're doing PhDs and we _literally_ teach degree/college students how to write Lab Reports _week-in week-out_.

We've brought together all those rules that took us years to learn, and have compiled them into one comprehensive, useful resource. For you.
