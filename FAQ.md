# What is this website about? {#websiteabout} 
This is the supplementary website to the eBook "How to Write a Lab Report" which will be launching on Amazon on the 14th March 2019.

We want to give you all the information you need about Lab Reports, so that you can become a Lab Report expert.

On this website you will find our frequently updated blog, where we offer useful tips and tricks on writing Lab Reports. We have loads of blog posts in the pipeline, so sign up to receive updates [here](https://labreport.org/blog-subscribe/)

We also post useful information about Lab Report writing on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_LabReport) and [Facebook](https://facebook.com/LabReport.Org)

# Who wrote the book, runs the website, and posts on social media? {#whoweare} 
You can find out all this information on the page [About Us](https://labreport.org/aboutus/)

To summarise, we are both teaching staff at University, and we largely teach students how to do good research and write up Lab Reports. We are also completing our PhDs.

Together we have extensive experience in how to write Lab Reports, and we want to share all that experience with you.

# When is the book available? {#launchdate}
The book will be available on Amazon from the 14th April 2019.

We have decided to publish on Amazon because this keeps costs low for you (avoiding publisher fees which would drive the price up), and also because it is a reputable marketing service. This means that you can trust the reviews and trust the seller.
